This repositor contains:
- the code for multifrequencies Qc analysis (fork from the [MuRAT code](https://github.com/LucaDeSiena/MuRAT));
- the ArcPy code for the import and map creation from the MATLAB output.

The dataset used for the Qc analysis (last obtained dataset from the [Qc data cleaning](https://github.com/RobertoGuardo/QcDataCleaning) process) are stored in the Zenodo repository [at this link](https://zenodo.org/deposit/6561124).
